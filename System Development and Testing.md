- Evaluated form validation feedback
- Tested on various devices (desktop, tablet) used in the cafe

## Testing Results

### Database Functionality Testing
- **Connection Tests**: Successfully established database connections with multiple configuration options; fallback mechanisms functioned as designed
- **Table Structure Tests**: Database tables properly created with correct relationships and constraints
- **Data Integrity Tests**: Foreign key relationships maintained data consistency; transaction rollbacks functioned correctly
- **Performance Tests**: Query execution times remained under defined thresholds even with increased data volume

### API Endpoint Testing
- **Authentication**: Login process correctly validated credentials; invalid attempts were properly rejected
- **Data Validation**: Input validation correctly prevented invalid data entry; error messages were clear and specific
- **Response Format**: All endpoints returned data in the expected format with proper status codes
- **Performance**: API response times remained below 1 second for standard operations under normal load

### User Interface Testing
- **Navigation Flow**: Users could intuitively navigate through the application
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation provided immediate feedback on input errors
- **Responsiveness**: Interface properly adapted to different screen sizes and orientations
- **Functionality**: All UI elements connected properly to backend functions; no broken links or actions

### Security Testing
- **Authentication**: Password security mechanisms functioned correctly; role-based access controls restricted unauthorized operations
- **Data Protection**: Sensitive data was properly protected in storage and transit
- **Session Management**: User sessions were correctly managed with appropriate timeout handling
- **Audit Logging**: All critical operations were logged with proper user information and timestamps

## Conclusions and Recommendations

### Conclusion
The development and testing of the Cafe Beata Inventory and Sales Management System has been successfully completed. The system effectively meets the requirements outlined in the initial project proposal, providing a comprehensive solution for managing inventory, processing sales, and generating insightful reports.

The implementation satisfies all core functional requirements:
- Complete inventory management with stock-in, stock-out, and adjustment capabilities
- Efficient supplier management with detailed contact information
- Robust sales processing with order status tracking
- Comprehensive reporting for inventory and sales analysis

The system also meets non-functional requirements including:
- Response times within specified thresholds (3 seconds for inventory operations, 2 seconds for sales operations)
- User-friendly interface requiring minimal training
- Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Data integrity and backup capabilities

Testing confirmed that the system operates reliably and efficiently, with appropriate error handling and performance characteristics. User acceptance testing validated that the system meets the practical needs of cafe staff in real-world scenarios.
